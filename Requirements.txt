Hello,
This is Lowell, the structural engineer you hired a few days ago on Freelancer. I’m very sorry to bring you this difficult message. I have been working on your project with all my effort, but while doing so, I have been struggling to set up my payment method. My Freelancer account has suddenly been placed under a temporary restriction, and I’m unable to add any payout option at the moment.

To be honest, this situation has been very stressful for me. I rely on this work to support my ill wife and our two children, and not being able to receive payments right now has put me in a really hard position. Even though I can complete your project, I won’t be able to get paid through the platform right now.

I feel very uncomfortable asking this… but would you consider using an alternative payment method just for this project? I completely understand if this is not possible for you, and I would never want to pressure you. If it’s not acceptable, I will understand and quietly step back. Your comfort and trust matter to me.

There is one more thing I must be honest about. As I continued working, I realized that I miscalculated the cost of the project. The actual workload is much larger than I initially expected, and I should have clarified this earlier. Based on my revised plan:

Architectural and structural plans: $2,000

Structural report: $500

HVAC: $800

Material list: $500

Total comes to $3,800 — but I am willing to reduce it to $3,000 for you.

I sincerely apologize for not being able to negotiate this properly from the start. I truly hope you can understand my situation. Thank you very much for your patience, kindness, and understanding.
